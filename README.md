# HulaminInterviewTask
Task Completed for Hulamin Interview
I have complied the files in X86 and X64.  Please find these files in the Install directory in the Hulamin folder, please install the one appropriate for your Oracle infrastructure.  In the install directories there is a .config file where the connection string can be changed in order to connect to your Oracle Database.
In the SQL folder, I have included the scripts for table, trigger, sequence and procedure creation on your database so that the app can access these tables.
